= Fixed-size array â†’ Calculations

https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/7259

Given below is an array of integers:

a = [3, 0, 3, 9, 2, 1]
The following procedures perform some calculations with the array:

1:

r = 7
for i in 0..len(a):
    x = a[i]
    x = x * x - x
    r += x
2:

r = 13
r += a[a[0]]
r -= a[a[len(a)-1]]
3:

r = 0
for i in 0..len(a):
    if a[i] < len(a):
        r += a[a[i]]
Print the final value of rr for each of the calculations in the field below. Separate the values by space. For example, your output may look like this:

2 10 7
